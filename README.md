# Work Day Scheduler

In this project, I was tasked with creating a workday scheduler that followed certain parameters. It must:

- Show the current date and time at the top of the calendar using moment.js
- Use time blocks to show the business hours
- Color-code each time block to show if it is in the past, present, or future
- Have a user input field in each time block
- Save the user input into local storage
- Keep the user input on the page after a refresh

The colors and overall wireframe layout were provided. The javascript and HTML for the timeblocks is my work.
